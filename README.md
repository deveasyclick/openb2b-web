# OpenB2B Web

## Overview

**OpenB2B Web** is the frontend application of OpenB2B ‚Äî an open-source, multi-tenant ordering and invoicing platform. This repository contains the React + TypeScript single-page app responsible for the user interface: product browsing, ordering, invoice viewing, and organization-level role interactions.

It‚Äôs ideal for building B2B storefronts for small wholesalers such as book distributors, restaurant supply vendors, event merchandise suppliers, and generic B2B product distributors. OpenB2B Web focuses on a polished, accessible UI, accurate order totals, and seamless integration with the backend API.

## API Documentation

The frontend communicates with the OpenB2B backend API. Detailed API reference and interactive Swagger UI are maintained in the backend docs. See `./docs/api.md` or the backend repository's documentation for API endpoints, request/response shapes, and authentication webhooks.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** React + TypeScript  
- **Build Tool:** Vite  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS  
- **Routing:** React Router  
- **State Management:** React Context API (and local hooks)  
- **Authentication (frontend):** Clerk (handles sign-in flows, OAuth, and session bootstrap)  
- **Bundler / Dev Server:** Vite  
- **Testing:** Vitest (recommended)  
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form
- **Data Fetching:** Tanstack Query

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.0.0 or higher; recommended v22.11.0)  
- pnpm (recommended) or npm / yarn  
- Git  

---

## Authentication

OpenB2B Web is configured to use [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication and session management. Clerk handles UI flows (signup, login, OAuth). The backend is responsible for mapping Clerk users to organizations and roles (via webhooks or custom claims).

For frontend setup details see `docs/authentication.md` (or the `auth` section in this repo). Make sure you have the appropriate Clerk keys configured as environment variables (see below).

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deveasyclick/openb2b-web.git
cd openb2b-web
```

### Install dependencies

Using pnpm (recommended):

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

---

## Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (Vite requires env vars to start with `VITE_`):

```env
# URL of the backend API (e.g. https://api.openb2b.example.com)
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com

# Clerk publishable key (or other frontend keys required by Clerk)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=clerk_publishable_key
```

---

## Development

### Run dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server (hot module replacement, fast refresh). The app will call `VITE_API_URL` for API requests.

### Common scripts

```bash
# build for production
pnpm build

# preview the production build locally
pnpm preview

# run tests
pnpm test

# run unit tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# run lint
pnpm lint

# format code
pnpm format
```

---

## Building & Production

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

The production-ready static files are generated in the `dist/` directory (Vite default). You can serve them with a static server or deploy to any static hosting provider.

### Preview

```bash
pnpm preview
```

This serves the built `dist/` locally so you can verify the production build.

---

## Local Production Serve (example)

Quick way to serve `dist/` locally using `serve`:

```bash
pnpm build
npx serve -s dist
```
